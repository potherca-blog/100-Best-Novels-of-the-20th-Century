The Modern Library's 100 Best Novels is a list of the best English-language novels of the 20th century as selected by the Modern Library, an American publishing company owned by Random House.

The list was created in 1998 by the Modern Library's editorial board which consisted of Daniel J. Boorstin, A. S. Byatt, Christopher Cerf, Shelby Foote, Vartan Gregorian, Edmund Morris, John Richardson, Arthur Schlesinger Jr., William Styron and Gore Vidal.

Criticism of the Modern Library list includes that it did not include enough novels by women (and that only one woman was on the panel) and not enough novels from outside North America and Europe. In addition, some contend it was a "sales gimmick", since most of the titles in the list are also sold by Modern Library.

A Reader's List 100 Best Novels was published separately by Modern Library in 1999 arrived at through an unscientific poll held amongst over 200,000 self-selected voters.

The Reader's Poll has been cited by Harry Binswanger, a longtime associate of Rand and promoter of her work, as representative of "the clash between the intellectual establishment and the American people." However, journalists such as Kyrie O'Connor and Jesse Walker have attributed the differences at the top of the list to ballot-stuffing or especially devoted followings, rather than accurate expressions of broad public opinion.

This code combines both lists to create a new, third list that is a mix between both.
All books that are available for free from [Project Gutenberg][gutenberg] are marked by cross-referencing this list with [Gutenbergs catalog][gutenberg_catalog]. This file can be updated by overwriting the `GUTINDEX.ALL.txt` file in the `Lists` directory with a more recent version.

If books one has read are added to the `ReadList.txt` file, these will be marked in the list as well.

You can view [my personal list][example] to get an example of the output.
